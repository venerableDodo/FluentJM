# FluentJM
 A repository to create a base ANSYS Fluent journal for HPC

As now the code can be changed to create simple starting point for fluent journaling to use with HPC.

The materials and models must be set before for granular choices.

The final code will be able to create a journal from scratch!

Feel free to contribute.
